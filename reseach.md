## ⚙️ Tools Considered

### TensorFlow
- Focused on **machine learning** and **deep learning** models.  
- Would involve creating a **full-blown ML model** for image classification.

### OpenCV
- More of a **computer vision toolkit**.  
- Works like a **custom filter** to analyze images (e.g., identifying cancer clumps).

> 🧩 *Observation:*  
> Most sources recommend **TensorFlow** for this project — that’s likely the best starting point.

## 🧰 Next Steps

- Consider building a **training data extraction tool**  
  (e.g., manually circling images of cancer regions for labeling).

## 🧬 Additional Resource

- **[The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net)**  
  Hosts a large collection of cancer images and provides an **API** for programmatic access.
